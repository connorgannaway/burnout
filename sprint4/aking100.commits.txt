Changing pages is easy, either clicking a card on the page will navigate to a page with more details, or changing the tab at the bottom of the screen will change to the Home Tab, Leagues Tab, or Settings Tab. Changing pages and then changing tabs, if the user decides to go back to the previous tab the page they were on will be saved.

This is the page where you can select between F1, NASCAR, etc. Since currently the only league with data on the app is F1, the other pages are blank. However, clicking on the Formula 1 card will take you to the Formula 1 page. On this page you will see the most recent race and the top three finishers as well as a table that lists the teams in order of their points and the drivers in order of points. Clicking on any of the teams or drivers will take you to their respective screens.

For Teams it will show you that teams data for all previous seasons that team has competed, as well as the drivers for this current season. If you click on the driver's card for that team it will take you to that driver's page where that drivers data will be displayed for this season as well as every previous season that driver has competed.
