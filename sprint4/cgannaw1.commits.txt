e916cadf (Connor Gannaway 2023-11-30 15:16:45 -0500 26) ### Installation Steps (Frontend)
e916cadf (Connor Gannaway 2023-11-30 15:16:45 -0500 33)    - Use `git clone https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/RaceMob.git` to clone the repository to your machine.
e916cadf (Connor Gannaway 2023-11-30 15:16:45 -0500 49) 2. **Open Expo Go on Your Smartphone**: Once opened, you will see an option to scan a QR code. If on iPhone, open the camera app instead.
e916cadf (Connor Gannaway 2023-11-30 15:16:45 -0500 58) 5. **View the App**: Once the build is complete, the app should automatically open on your phone. If not, you should be able to manually open it from a list of apps on Expo Go's home page.
e916cadf (Connor Gannaway 2023-11-30 15:16:45 -0500 59) 
e916cadf (Connor Gannaway 2023-11-30 15:16:45 -0500 60) #### Important Notice
e916cadf (Connor Gannaway 2023-11-30 15:16:45 -0500 61) To run and use the app, this is all that is needed to be done. The app is configured to use our current staging API hosted at `https://pitwall.connorgannaway.net`.  If there are issues with the app loading, check the [Network Status](https://status.connorgannaway.net). To run your own backend server, follow the instructions below.
e916cadf (Connor Gannaway 2023-11-30 15:16:45 -0500 62) 
e916cadf (Connor Gannaway 2023-11-30 15:16:45 -0500 63) ### Installation Steps (Backend)
e916cadf (Connor Gannaway 2023-11-30 15:16:45 -0500 64) 1. **Install Python**: Install Python >= 3.10 from https://www.python.org.
e916cadf (Connor Gannaway 2023-11-30 15:16:45 -0500 65) 2. **Create a virtual environment**:
e916cadf (Connor Gannaway 2023-11-30 15:16:45 -0500 66)    - Navigate to `RaceMob/app/backend`.
e916cadf (Connor Gannaway 2023-11-30 15:16:45 -0500 67)    - Run the command `python -m venv venv`. This will create a virtual envirionment using Python's venv package called venv.
e916cadf (Connor Gannaway 2023-11-30 15:16:45 -0500 68)    - Activate this virtual environment by running `.\venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows or `. venv/bin/activate` on Linux.
e916cadf (Connor Gannaway 2023-11-30 15:16:45 -0500 69) 3. **Install Packages**: To install necessary backend packages, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
e916cadf (Connor Gannaway 2023-11-30 15:16:45 -0500 70) 4. **Setup Database**: This step is NOT NECESSARY if you are using the included sqlite3 file. For ease of use, we've included the development database to help mitigate errors in importing data.
e916cadf (Connor Gannaway 2023-11-30 15:16:45 -0500 71)    - Run `python manage.py migrate`. This will create the database and tables.
e916cadf (Connor Gannaway 2023-11-30 15:16:45 -0500 72)    - Import data from `Racemob/app/backend/csv`. The preferred tool for this is [DataGrip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/)
e916cadf (Connor Gannaway 2023-11-30 15:16:45 -0500 73) 5. **Run the Backend Server**: Run the server using `python manage.py runserver`
e916cadf (Connor Gannaway 2023-11-30 15:16:45 -0500 74) 
e916cadf (Connor Gannaway 2023-11-30 15:16:45 -0500 75) ### API Endpoints
e916cadf (Connor Gannaway 2023-11-30 15:16:45 -0500 76) The following endpoints are accessible when running your local backend server or at the [Staging API](https://pitwall.connorgannaway.net/version).
