### What you planned to do
I planned to:

- Add API to the race page.

### What you did not do
I did everything I planned to do

### What problems you encountered
Implementing navigation to the race page.

### Issues you worked on

[#150](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/RaceMob/issues/150)
[#151](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/RaceMob/issues/151)

### Files you worked on
(Give a bulleted list of the files in your github repo that you worked on. Give the full pathname.)
/app/frontend/burnout/screens/racescreen.js
/app/frontend/burnout/api/races.js
/app/frontend/burnout/api/racedetails.js
/app/frontend/burnout/components/stack.js

### What you accomplished
(Give a description of the features you added or tasks you accomplished. Provide some detail here. This section will be a little longer than the bulleted lists above) 

The race page now dynamically renders data from the API based on what was passed
to the props of the race brief card where the race originated from.
The design was overhauled.
