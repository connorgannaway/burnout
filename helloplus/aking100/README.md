# React Native Application

This is a simple app that I run using Expo Go.

It is run using the command ```npx expo start``` from the directory. Then I 
open the Expo Go app on my phone and scan the generated QR code.

This might be used in my group project because it taught me how to import 
images and use buttons to do actions like open and close the image and 
display a pop-up.
