This is my first attempt at utilizing react native with
expo to create a mobile app. I have created a simple
"hello world" to play with while viewing the setup on my
phone. This will be a great way to view our project from
a true consumer perspective.

### To Use:
 - I used a tutorial for setting up React native with expo as the live editor
 - Make sure you have npm working on your machine
 - 'npm install --global expo-cli'
 - cd into the helloplus/pdavis43/project_test/racemob_test_page directory
 - `npx expo start` to start the expo server
 - download 'expogo' app on your phone and login with the same account as the expo server
 - scan the QR code from the expo server to open the app on your phone
 - you can now edit the code in the project_test/racemob_test_page/App.js file and see the changes live on your phone
