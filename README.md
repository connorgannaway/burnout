### Project Documentation

#### Requirements
- A computer running MacOS, Windows, or Linux.
- A smartphone running iOS or Android for running the app using Expo Go.

#### Installation Steps
1. **Install Node.js and npm**: Download and install Node.js (which includes npm) from [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/). If you are on Linux, you can install the nodejs and npm as packages.
If you encounter any issues, make sure you have Python, NodeJS and jdk8 installed in your system if not, install them.

2. **Install React Native CLI**: Open a terminal and run `npm install -g react-native-cli`.

3. **Clone the GitHub Repository**:
   - Use `git clone https://github.com/[GitHub_Username]/RaceMob.git` to clone the repository to your machine.

4. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: 
   - After cloning, navigate to this directory: `RaceMob/app/frontend/burnout`.

5. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` to install all the required dependencies listed in the `package.json` file. You may need to install yarn, which you can do by running `npm install yarn`.

6. **Expo Go Installation**:
   - For iOS: Download the “Expo Go” app from the Apple App Store.
   - For Android: Download the “Expo Go” app from the Google Play Store.

7. **Start the React Native Server**: Run `npx expo start` in the project directory. This will start the Metro Bundler.

#### Running the App on Your Phone
1. **Make Sure Your Phone and Computer Are On The Same Network**: This is necessary for the Expo Go app to access the React Native server running on your computer.

2. **Open Expo Go on Your Smartphone**: Once opened, you will see an option to scan a QR code.

3. **Scan the QR Code with Expo Go**:
   - A QR code will appear in the terminal or command prompt where you started the React Native server.
   - Scan this QR code using the Expo Go app.

4. **Open the Project in Expo Go**:
   - After scanning, the app should start building on your phone. 

5. **View the App**: Once the build is complete, the app should automatically open on your phone. If not, you should be able to manually open it from a list of apps on Expo Go's home page.
