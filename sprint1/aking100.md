### What you accomplished

I helped setup a stack navigator and helped implement it into the card. 
I modified the card so when the card object is created one can specify what path to navigate to from the card.
I designed the leagues screen using the aforementioned card and formatted that screen.
I formatted the buttons in the upper right corner of the header bar.
I designed the color and text color of the header bar.
