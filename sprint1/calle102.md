### What you accomplished
I worked on a screen for the individual leagues. Originally, I made my own, but Andrew also made one that I thought was better, so I instead got the navigation working for that. 
I also implemented the cards with dummy data on that screen. I also did some misc design and formatting, and also helped design the initial drawings for the pages.
