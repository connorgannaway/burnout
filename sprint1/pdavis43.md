---

Name: Peyton Davis 
GitHub: peytonad
Group: RaceMob

### What you planned to do
 - Create Base Card [#75](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/RaceMob/issues/75)
 - Create Search Bar and Search Dialogue [#76](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/RaceMob/issues/76)
 - Create Calendar Widget [#77](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall23/RaceMob/issues/77)

### What you did not do
I accomplished all of the tasks I set out to do this sprint.

### What problems you encountered
 - I was initially using the wrong react library for the base cards. This led me to have to redo the base cards.
   This could have been avoided if I communicated with the rest of the team sooner.
 - I also had some issues correectly displaying the calendar widget. I don't know exactly what the issue was, but
   the problemed resolved itself when I cleared the cache and restarted the server.

### Issues you worked on

### What you accomplished
I was able to accomplish a few working frontend features this sprint. The base card will be implemented throughout
the frontend of the RaceMob app. Though many changes will be made, this gives the team a rough idea of cards will
look like. These cards can hold anything from athlete descriptions to league information to race scheduling.
The search bar was a little more tricky, as I needed to find a way for the search bar to return the text being input.
In the long run, this search bar will be located on the top bar of the app on all pages and allow for the user to 
affect the queries to the backend. Lastly, the calendar widget (named Date Picker) is a first step at creating and
implementing filters the data. In communication with the team, there are already some built-in filters for the
database, but this will allow the users to filter out select date ranges.
