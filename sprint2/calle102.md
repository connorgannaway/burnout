### What you did not do

- API integration
- I didn't really get the cards formatted to the end state

### What problems you encountered

CSS styling can be very frustrating and tedious to deal with

### Files you worked on

app\frontend\burnout\components\standingscard.js
app\frontend\burnout\components\schedulecard.js
app\frontend\burnout\screens\leaguemasterscreen.js


### What you accomplished

I added a card to display the top 5 in points, it currently navigates to a test screen, but it will go to the full points standings
I added a card to show the next 5 races, it will navigate to the full schedule
Having 2 cards seems a bit redundant but it seemed easier to make 2 than to figure out how to formate them differently
